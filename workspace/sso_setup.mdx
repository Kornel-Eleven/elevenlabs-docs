<Info> Only workspace admins can use this feature. </Info>

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows your team to log in to ElevenLabs using your existing identity provider. This means that your team can use the same credentials they use for other services to log in to ElevenLabs.

## Choosing identity providers
To access your SSO settings, click on your profile icon located at the bottom left of the dashboard, select Workspace Settings, and then navigate to the SECURITY & SSO tab.

You can choose from a variety of identity providers, including Google, Okta, github, etc.

If you disable any of the identity providers, your team members will log out if they're using the disabled providers.

## Verifying your domain
Next, you need to verify your domain so that you let ElevenLabs know that you own the domain you are setting up SSO for. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to your workspace.

- Click on the `Verify domain` button.

- Enter the domain name you want to verify.

- You'll be prompted to add a DNS TXT record to the DNS settings of your domain. An example is as below. You can contact your domain administrator or IT team for help with this step. Once the DNS record is added, click on the `Verify` button again.

- Once the domain is successfully verified, the status of your domain will change to `Passed`.

## Configure SSO

### Create an OIDC (OpenID Connect) configuration
ElevenLabs OpenID integrations uses both the [Authorization Code Flow](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow) and [Implicit Flow](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/implicit-flow-with-form-post).

To configure SSO with OIDC, you need:
- Client ID for your application
- Response Type: `Code` or `Id Token`
- Client Secret for your application (if you are using `Code`)
- Issuer URL (Identity Provider URL)

Steps:
- Register an OIDC application with your identity provider.
- For authorization call back url, use the greyed out link at the bottom of the SECURITY & SSO tab in Workspace Settings.
- Add the required fields (Client ID, Issuer URL, etc.) to the ElevenLabs SSO configuration.

  - Identity Provider ID
